    title: "Bigger Biodiversity Benefits for your Buck: How economic instruments can help safeguard nature ",
    desc: "Ten million hectares of forest are destroyed each year. Live coral has declined by about 4% per decade since 1990. And one million plant and animal species—one quarter of all species—are now threatened with extinction. The past decade has not yielded the biodiversity outcomes that many hoped for when the 2011-2020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity was adopted, under the auspices of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). As a result, biodiversity loss continues to accelerate, posing significant risks to our economy and the well-being of current and future generations. The 15th Conference of the Parties to the CBD (CBD COP15)—where a post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework is due to be agreed—is critical. It is our chance to take stock of lessons learned, and to design a better, more effective framework for the next decade. A framework that includes specific actions countries can take to address the pressures on biodiversity, whether it is land and sea-use change, over-exploitation, pollution, climate change or invasive alien species.",

    desc: "Students around the world who have recently finished their secondary education are about to face a new phase of their lives. Those planning to continue their studies, whether in a university setting or through a vocational education and training course, are making choices that will impact their future career prospects. Many factors influence people’s plans for training and education: a passion for a specific subject or an activity; employment opportunities; and location, to name a few. With efforts to mitigate climate change affecting economies and increasing the demand for green occupations, a key question is whether climate change and climate change mitigation policies should become a deciding factor for educational choices.",

    title: "Towards a Clean Energy Transition in Viet Nam",
    desc: "Vietnam’s current development highlights the urgent need to accelerate the global energy transition. John Rockhold, head of the Power and Energy Working Group under the Vietnam Business Forum, looks at how events have demonstrated the cost to the global economy of a centralised energy system dependent on fossil fuels. The energy transition in Vietnam is tied to the rapid growth of the economy, urbanisation, and industrialisation. We have seen the strong aspiration of the government to speed up the energy transition while meeting the requirements of economic development and the goal of becoming a high-income country by 2045. Energy transition is more seen as a potential engine for employment, and this trend will likely grow, helping to build support for renewables.",
